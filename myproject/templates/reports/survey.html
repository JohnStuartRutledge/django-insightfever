        <li>General cleanliness of public facilities: elevators, trash area, etc, was the 2nd biggest concern.</li>
        <li>Staff availability</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Complements</h3>

        <li>The location is excellent, the staff are the best</li>
        <li>the staff has always been so nice and its such a pleasure to go into the office</li>
        <li>staff very helpful</li>
        <li>Definitely better than the previous year!! Great staff</li>
        <li>The Office staff is always attentive and helpful. I really enjoy working on my new lease with Cindy!</li>
        <li>The office people are very helpful and worked hard into getting me in this complex.</li>

        <li>The area and apartments are very nice and fun to live in.</li>
        <li>maintenance is very fast</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Suggestions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>would like valet trash pickup to be optional.</li>
        <li>install a metal gate (arm) to replace the wood one.</li>
        <li>online/digital maintenance request form.</li>
        <li>some sort of surveillance system to discourage destruction of property. If that proves to be too
            expensive, then perhaps installing dummy surveillance (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Dummy-Security-Camera-Blinking/dp/B0013Q1XTM/ref=pd_bxgy_p_img_c">like this</a>).</li>
        <li>More outdoor night lighting.</li>
    </ul>
